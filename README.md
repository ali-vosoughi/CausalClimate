## CausalClimate


Here is the code implementation of the following paper:

- Relation Discovery in Nonlinearly Related Large-Scale Settings, ICASSP 2022

For the official acccess please see:

I will make the preprint available in a later time! 

Climate change perhaps is one of the most challenging problems of the 21st century. The paper proposes a method to obtain causal graphical representations from the nodal recodings.
The repository provides the simulation of graph inference by considering causality, which is a novel method. We show the algorithm using both synthetic networks and real-world climatology data.

## CausalClimate

Climate change perhaps is one of the most challenging problems of the 21st century. The paper proposes a method that addresses obtaining causal graphical representations from the nodal recodings.
The repository provides the simulation of graph inference by considering causality, which is a novel method. We show the algorithm using both synthetic networks and real-world climatology data.
